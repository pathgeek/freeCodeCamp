 You are given a JSON object representing (a small part of) your record collection. 
 Each album is identified by a unique id number and has several properties. Not all albums have complete information.
Write a function which takes an id, a property (prop), and a value.

For the given id in collection:
1) If value is non-blank (value !== "") and prop is not "tracks" then update or set the value for the prop.
2) If the prop is "tracks" and value is non-blank, push the value onto the end of the tracks array.
3) If value is blank, delete that prop.
